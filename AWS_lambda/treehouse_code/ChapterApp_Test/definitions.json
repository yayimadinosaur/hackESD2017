	 "Neural Networks" :  "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or  systems are computing systems inspired by the  that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve performance) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually  as  cat  or  no cat  and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express in a traditional computer algorithm using .An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called , (analogous to  in a ). Each connection () between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by , typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a  that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Further, they may have a threshold such that only if the aggregate signal is below (or above) that level is the downstream signal sent.Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.",

Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers.  analyzes the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, savings, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), inflation, economic growth, and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies).",
	 "Augmented Reality" : "New augmented reality software from  and  will be  huge  in taking the technology to the mainstream, a prominent tech evangelist told CNBC on Monday.  I think it's huge because it lets developers start to learn how to build this kind of software,  Robert Scoble, a partner at Transformation Group, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology.Apple's  is one of the features on the company's iOS 11 that will be released on Sept. 19. The new platform will take  apps beyond the screen  by letting users of the software create AR experiences for iPhones and iPads, according to the company. Google's ARCore is a similar software development platform for Android phones. The reason why those platforms are needed, Scoble explained, is if smartglasses eventually become lighter and more widely adopted, there needs to be enough interesting software.  We need developers to learn how to build that kind of software using sensor fusion, using the new 3D sensor, using the new kinds of ways to see the world ... We need them to build a lot of software so when the glasses world does arrive, there's lots of things to do,  Scoble said. The uses of augmented and virtual reality software aren't limited to just fun and games, either â€” Scoble pointed to computer-aided design as a segment that provided growth opportunities.  People who are building cars or buildings are using Autodesk or AutoCAD ... and that's a huge market. That market is [worth,] I think, around $20 billion. If those people start needing augmented reality to see their models in new ways, that's going to be a huge change,  he explained, pointing to how Shanghai Disneyland was designed using VR. Scoble, who is known in part for his Scobleizer blog, also weighed in on why he thought virtual reality hasn't been widely adopted despite the hype surrounding the technology. Unlike AR, which mixes the real and virtual worlds, VR simulates an environment in which users immerse themselves through , such as the  Vive and  Oculus Rift. The headsets are expensive and they're dorky,  Scoble pointed out.He added:  You need to hook them up to a PC. I just spent $2,000 on my PC, which has a ... big GPU [graphics processing unit,] which is what you need to spray the kinds of polygons around you to give you a really nice experience. So that's $2,500 right there to get started ... It's way too nerdy, way too dorky. Another reason why mass market adoption hasn't caught on, he said, is the difficulty in getting people to experience the technology for themselves.  It's hard for people to try it. Out of a thousand people walking around the show floor here, how many have actually had more than five minutes in a headset? Very, very few,  said Scoble.  So it's going to be a slow burn.
